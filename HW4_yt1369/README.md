## Homework3
## Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem
First, I get to know the rule of each distribution include Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Chi-Squared distribution, Binomal distribution and t-distribution;
then I use numpy to generste 100 samples and plot each sample mean, I also plot the distribution of all sample means.

## Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data. 
I choose the July 2017 trips data from citibike website, and I decide to look into the age aspect.
My question is: Is post-90s more likely than pre-90s to use citibike for commute?
To achieve the answer of this question, I have group work with Cheng Ma, Vivian and Zhiao Zhou.

## Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook
In this assignment, I look into whether the new bus route improved commute question, and I use Z-test to figure out this question.
