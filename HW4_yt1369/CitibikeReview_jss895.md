a. the Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly.

b. the data jss895 choosen supports the project: the gender data answered the question he raised in the beginning: Does the average trip time for citibike is affected by the gender of the person that made the trip? jss895 also extracted the tripduration-gender data and droped the extreme data to make the dataset reasonable.

c. I chose z test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked.

Write your comments, suggestions, and suggested an appropriate statistical test, motivating your test choice, in a markdown named CitibikeReview_<netID>.md. Suggest variations on the question, if you think it may be made more interesting.
