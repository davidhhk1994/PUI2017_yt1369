# FBB I asked to include this table in the folder repo

# FBB there cannot be no DV variable: what can you measure if there is none: the anova meansure the difference of means between groups, which group is the IV. the quantity that is measured, in this case the locomotive activity, is the IV. Note that your table is shifted. 
## correlation: missing control variables

# otherwise ok
