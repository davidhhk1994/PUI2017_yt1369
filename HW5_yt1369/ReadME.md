## Assignment 1
I generate samples from poisson distribution, plot the original distribution and four samples, I alsoplot the distribution of z statistics.
The hard part for me is fit the z-statistics with a gaussian model.

## Assignment 2.
The skeleton gives many hints to finish this assignment, though increasing the lambda parameter of poisson distribution is confusing and I spend much time to interpret the entropy.

## Assignment 3.
In this assignment, the difficult part for me is statsmodels WLS.
